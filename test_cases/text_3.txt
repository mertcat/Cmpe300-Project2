now it is time for radiohead!!!
When you were here before.
Couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel.
Your skin makes me cry...
You float like a feather 2
In a beautiful world
I wish , I was special
You're so fuckin' special
I don't care if it hurts.
I wanna have control!
I want a perfect body.
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice, when I am NOT around
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep!
I'm a weirdo!
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here...
Sing us a song, a song to keep us warm.
There's such a chill, such a chill...
And you can laugh, a spineless laugh.
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you!
And now we are one, in eveRlasting PEACE.
We hope that you choke, that you choke.
I'll take a quiet life.
A handshake of carbon monoxide.
And no alarms and no surprises.
No alarms and no surprises.
No alarms and no surprises.
In a little while, I'll be gone.
The moment's already passed.
Yeah, it's gone and I'm not here.
This isn't happening.
I'm not here, I'm not here.
Strobe lights and blown speakers, Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here, this isn't happening.
I'm not here, I'm not here.
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life.
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes!
All these things into position.
All these things we'll one day swallow whole...
Kill me Sarah!
Kill me again with love!
It's gonna be a glorious day.
Pull me out of the air crash.
Pull me out of the lake.
'Cause I'm your superhero.
We are standing on the edge.
Karma police, I've given all I can.
It's not enough, I've given all I can,
But we're still on the payroll.
